DIGIWAGE Core version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/DIGIWAGE-Qt (on Mac) or digiwaged/digiwage-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes
==============

(Developers: add your notes here as part of your pull requests whenever possible)


### Deprecated autocombinerewards RPC Command

The `autocombinerewards` RPC command was soft-deprecated in v5.3.0 and replaced with explicit setter/getter commands `setautocombinethreshold`/`getautocombinethreshold`. DIGIWAGE Core, by default, will no longer accept the `autocombinerewards` command, returning a deprecation error, unless the `digiwaged`/`digiwage-qt` is started with the `-deprecatedrpc=autocombinerewards` option.

This command will be fully removed in v6.0.0.

### Shield address support for RPC label commands

The `setlabel` RPC command now supports a shield address input argument to allow users to set labels for shield addresses. Additionally, the `getaddressesbylabel` RPC command will also now return shield addresses with a matching label.

### Specify optional label for getnewshieldaddress

The `getnewshieldaddress` RPC command now takes an optional argument `label (string)` to denote the desired label for the generated address.

P2P connection management
--------------------------

- Peers manually added through the addnode option or addnode RPC now have their own
  limit of sixteen connections which does not compete with other inbound or outbound
  connection usage and is not subject to the maxconnections limitation.

- New connections to manually added peers are much faster.
