DIGIWAGE Core version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/DIGIWAGE-Qt (on Mac) or digiwaged/digiwage-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes

Deterministic Masternode Lists
------------------------------

DIGIWAGE v6.0.0 introduces on-chain consensus for masternode lists, which allow for deterministic quorum derivation, implementing Dash's [DIP-0003](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md).

In the previous masternode system, each node needed to maintain their own individual masternode list with P2P messages, thus discrepancies might occur, for example, due to a different order of message reception.
Deterministic Masternode lists are lists of masternodes, built at every block, relying only on on-chain data (previous list, and transactions included in the current block).
All nodes derive (and verify) their masternode lists independently, from the same on-chain transactions, thus they immediately reach consensus on the tier-two state (number of masternodes, properties and status of each one).

Masternodes are "registered" by special transactions called ProTx, and removed only by spending the collateral.
A ProTx either creates a 10000-WAGE collateral as tx output, or includes a reference to an unspent 10000-WAGE utxo on chain (and a proof of ownership).
See PR [#2267](https://github.com/DIGIWAGE-Project/DIGIWAGE/pull/2267) for more information.

    to the masternode owner.

    Arguments:
    1. "proTxHash"    (string, required) The hash of the initial ProRegTx.
    2. "operatorKey"  (string, optional) The operator BLS private key associated with the registered operator public key.

    ```
    protx update_registrar \"proTxHash\" \"operatorPubKey\" \"votingAddress\" \"payoutAddress\" (\"ownerKey\")

    address of the masternode specified by \"proTxHash\".
    The owner key of this masternode must be known to your wallet.

    Creates and sends a ProUpServTx to the network. This will update the IP address
    of a masternode, and/or the operator payout address.
    If the IP is changed for a masternode that got PoSe-banned, the ProUpServTx will also revive this masternode.

    Arguments:
    1. "proTxHash"             (string, required) The hash of the initial ProRegTx.
    2. "operatorPubKey         (string, required) The operator BLS public key. The private BLS key does not have to be known.

                                  If set to an empty string, the currently active operator BLS public key is reused.
    3. "votingAddress"         (string, required) The voting key address. The private key does not have to be known by your wallet.
                                  It has to match the private key which is later used when voting on proposals.
                                  If set to an empty string, the currently active voting key address is reused.
    4. "payoutAddress"         (string, required) The DIGIWAGE address to use for masternode reward payments.
                                  If set to an empty string, the currently active payout address is reused.
    5. "ownerKey"              (string, optional) The owner key associated with the operator address of the masternode.
                                  If not specified, or set to an empty string, then the mn key must be known by your wallet,
                                  in order to sign the tx.

    ```
    protx_update_service "proTxHash" "ipAndPort" ("operatorPayoutAddress" "operatorKey")

    Creates and sends a ProUpServTx to the network. This will update the IP address
    of a masternode, and/or the operator payout address.
    If the IP is changed for a masternode that got PoSe-banned, the ProUpServTx will also revive this masternode.

    Arguments:
    1. "proTxHash"             (string, required) The hash of the initial ProRegTx.
    2. "ipAndPort"             (string, required) IP and port in the form "IP:PORT".
                                 If set to an empty string, the currently active ip is reused.
    3. "operatorPayoutAddress" (string, optional) The address used for operator reward payments.

                                 If not specified, or set to an empty string, then this command must be performed on the active
                                 masternode with the corresponding operator key.

    ```

#### GUI changes

!TODO

#### Protocol changes

Starting with the enforcement block, masternode rewards and budget payments are paid as outputs of the coinbase transaction, instead of the coinstake transaction.
With this rule, a new opcode (`0xd2`) is introduced (see PR [#2275](https://github.com/DIGIWAGE-Project/DIGIWAGE/pull/2275)).
It enforces the same rules as the legacy cold-staking opcode, but without allowing a "free" script for the last output of the transaction.
The new opcode takes the name of `OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY`, and the legacy opcode (`0xd1`) is renamed to `OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY_LOF` (last-output-free).
Scripts with the old opcode are still accepted on the network (the restriction on the last-output is enforced after the script validation in this case), but the client creates new delegations with the new opcode, by default, after the upgrade enforcement.
