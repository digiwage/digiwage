DIGIWAGE Core version v5.4.0 is now available from: <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/releases>

This is a new major version release, including a brand-new visual graphical interface for the Governance system, tier two network stability improvements, various bug fixes and performance enhancements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/digiwage-project/digiwage/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/DIGIWAGE-Qt (on Mac) or digiwaged/digiwage-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes
==============

## GUI:

* Brand-new governance graphic user interface! Styled for both themes, light and dark! Now you will be able to:
  - Watch and follow active proposals live.
  - Create new proposal using a simple three steps wizard (The wallet will automatically create the transaction and relay the proposal to the network without any further interaction).
  - Follow how many blocks left for the next superblock, the allocated and the available amounts.
  - Vote for proposals functionality with a multi-masternode voting wizard and change vote on-demand.
  - Filter proposals by status, votes count and more.
* Masternode rewards have been included into the dashboard chart.
* Address search functionality for cold-staking screen.
* More precise after-fee calculation.
* Wallet startup screen presenting needed disk space per-network.
* Fix "null" name for wallet automatic backups.
* Fix bug during restart process that blocked the wallet for being automatically restarted.

## Wallet

* Improved transaction inputs selection, preferring coins that have fewer ancestors (preventing tx rejection for long mempool chains).

* Much faster shield transactions processing during block reception (faster synchronization for large wallets).

## RPC Server

### Deprecated 'autocombinerewards' Command

The `autocombinerewards` RPC command was soft-deprecated in v5.3.0 and replaced with explicit setter/getter commands `setautocombinethreshold`/`getautocombinethreshold`. DIGIWAGE Core, by default, will no longer accept the `autocombinerewards` command, returning a deprecation error, unless the `digiwaged`/`digiwage-qt` is started with the `-deprecatedrpc=autocombinerewards` option.

This command will be fully removed in v6.0.0.

### Shield address support for RPC label commands

The `setlabel` RPC command now supports a shield address input argument to allow users to set labels for shield addresses. Additionally, the `getaddressesbylabel` RPC command will also now return shield addresses with a matching label.

### Specify optional label for getnewshieldaddress

The `getnewshieldaddress` RPC command now takes an optional argument `label (string)` to denote the desired label for the generated address.

P2P connection management
--------------------------

- Peers manually added through the addnode option or addnode RPC now have their own
  limit of sixteen connections which does not compete with other inbound or outbound
  connection usage and is not subject to the maxconnections limitation.

- New connections to manually added peers are much faster.
