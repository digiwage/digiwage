DIGIWAGE Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[DIGIWAGE Core](http://digiwage.org/wallet) is the original DIGIWAGE client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of DIGIWAGE transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run DIGIWAGE Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/digiwage-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/digiwaged` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run digiwage-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag DIGIWAGE-Qt to your applications folder, and then run DIGIWAGE-Qt.
